# Project Description

This project is a shopping website consisting of four pages: the homepage, the shopping cart page, the wishlist page, and the product details page. It is built using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

Technologies Used:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: A framework for server-rendered React applications.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

State Management:

The project utilizes Redux for state management. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, which helps manage the application's global state.

UI Design:

The UI of the project is designed using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes for building responsive and stylish user interfaces.

API Integration:

The project uses a fake API for data retrieval. This allows for testing and development without relying on a real backend server.

Due to the unavailability of an API, the product details data is obtained from the searchParams of the URL. This allows the project to retrieve and display the relevant details for the product on the product details page.

Project Timeline:

The project was completed from Friday, December 8, 2023, to Saturday, December 9, 2023.
